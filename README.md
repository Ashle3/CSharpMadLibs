# Overview

Since the C# language is so widely used in the software development industry, I thought it would be wise to familiarize myself with it by creating a small Mad Libs program. This program allowed me to learn the very basics of the language, such as creating and calling methods, printing lines, and getting user input. By learning these basics, I increase my knowledge as a software engineer, and learn skills that will be beneficial to my career.  

This software essentially acts as a Mad Libs game and generates silly sentences with your inputs. There are three different sentence structures to choose from. Once you choose a sentence, you are then given prompts for that specific sentence (i.e. "Enter an adjective"). The software then takes your answers to those prompts, and inserts them into the sentence structure to create your own silly sentence. 

My purpose for creating this software, was to expand my knowledge of the C# language, by creating a simple Mad Libs game.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to develop the software were Visual Studio 2022, to write and edit the software code, and GitHub, to save and upload my code to a public platform.

The programming language that I used was C#. In terms of libraries, I used the main 'System' library.

# Useful Websites

- W3Schools https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php
- YouTube video showing C# arrays https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiE0oetGMAg
 Even though I didn't use arrays in this software, I found this YouTube video to be helpful for future projects in the C# language.

# Future Work

- I could improve my software by making the sentences into longer stories.
- I could add more story/sentence options to the software.
- When creating more options, I could add genres that story structures could be listed under, such as action, fantasy, etc.
